# Conventions

``Code samples``, ``filenames``, ``directories`` and ``class names`` are presented in a courier typeface.

Square braces are used in code samples, filenames, URLs, and class names to indicate a sample value: for example, ``[anything]Handler.inc.php`` can be interpreted as any file name ending in Handler.inc.php.

The URL http://www.mylibrary.com used in many examples is intended as a fictional illustration only.
