# Page Classes

Pages classes receive requests from users' web browsers, delegate any required processing to various other classes, and call up the appropriate Smarty template to generate a response (if necessary). All page classes are located in the ``pages`` directory, and each of them must extend the ``Handler`` class (see ``classes/core/Handler.inc.php``).

Additionally, page classes are responsible for ensuring that user requests are valid and any authentication requirements are met. As much as possible, user-submitted form parameters and URL parameters should be handled in Page classes and not elsewhere, unless a Form class is being used to handle parameters.

An easy way to become acquainted with the tasks a Page class must fulfill is to examine a typical one. The file ``pages/about/AboutHandler.inc.php`` contains the code implementing the class ``AboutHandler``, which handles requests such as ``http://www.mylibrary.com/ojs2/myjournal/about/siteMap``. This is a fairly simple Page class responsible for fetching and displaying various metadata about the journal and site being viewed.

Each Page class implements a number of functions that can be called by the user by addressing the appropriate Page class and function in the request URL. (See the section titled â€œRequest Handling" for more information on the mapping between URLs and page classes.)

Often, Page classes handle requests based on the role the user is playing. For example, there is a Page class called ``AuthorHandler`` (in the directory ``pages/author/AuthorHandler.inc.php``) that delegates processing of the various tasks an author might perform. Similarly, there are classes called ``LayoutEditorHandler``, ``ManagerHandler``, and so forth.

The number of tasks a Page handler must perform can frequently be considerable. For example, if all requests for Section Editor functions were handled directly by the ``SectionEditorHandler`` class, it would be extremely large and difficult to maintain. Instead, functions are further subdivided into several other classes (such as ``SubmissionEditHandler`` and ``SubmissionCommentsHandler``), with ``SectionEditorHandler`` itself remaining just to invoke the specific subclass.
