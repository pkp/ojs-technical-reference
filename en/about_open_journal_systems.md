# About Open Journal Systems

Open Journal Systems (OJS) is a journal management and publishing system that has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project through its federally funded efforts to expand and improve access to research. OJS assists with every stage of the refereed publishing process, from submissions through to online publication and indexing. Through its management systems, its finely grained indexing of research, and the context it provides for research, OJS seeks to improve both the scholarly and public quality of referred research. OJS is open source software made freely available to journals worldwide for the purpose of making open access publishing a viable option for more journals, as open access can increase a journal's readership as well as its contribution to the public good on a global scale.

Version 2.x represents a complete rebuild and rewrite of Open Journal Systems 1.x, based on two years of working with the editors of the 250 journals using OJS in whole or in part around the world. With the launch of OJS v2.0, the Public Knowledge Project is moving its open source software development (including Open Conference Systems and PKP Harvester) to Simon Fraser University Library, in a partnership that also includes the Canadian Center for Studies in Publishing at SFU.

User documentation for OJS 2.x can be found on the Internet at http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_documentation; a demonstration site is available at http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_demo.
