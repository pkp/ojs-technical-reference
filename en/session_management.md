# Session Management

Session management is provided by the Session model class, ``SessionDAO``, and the ``SessionManager`` class (``classes/session/SessionManager.inc.php``).

While ``Session`` and ``SessionDAO`` manage database-persistent sessions for individual users, ``SessionManager`` is concerned with the technical specifics of sessions as implemented for PHP and Apache.
