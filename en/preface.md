# Preface

The Public Knowledge Project is a research and development initiative directed toward improving the scholarly and public quality of academic research through the development of innovative online publishing and knowledge-sharing environments.

Begun in 1998, PKP has developed [Open Journal Systems](http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs) and [Open Conference Systems](http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs), free software for the management, publishing, and indexing of journals and conferences, as well as [Open Archives Harvester](http://pkp.sfu.ca/harvester) and [Lemon8-XML](http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8) to facilitate the indexing of research and scholarship. This open source software is being used around the world to increase access to knowledge and improve its scholarly management, while considerably reducing publishing costs. See the PKP website for demos, downloads, and information about these systems.

Located at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/), [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/), [Stanford University](http://ed.stanford.edu/suse/), <!-- and [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/),--> the PKP also sustains an active research program on the impact of increased access to knowledge, with the resulting publications, dating back to 1998, available on the website.
