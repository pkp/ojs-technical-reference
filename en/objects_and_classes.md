# Objects & Classes

Plugins in OJS 2.x are object-oriented. Each plugin extends a class defining its category's functions and is responsible for implementing them.

**Table 5.1. Plugins**

| Category | Base Class |
| ----- | ----- |
| ``generic`` | ``GenericPlugin (classes/plugins/GenericPlugin.inc.php)`` |
| ``importexport`` | ``ImportExportPlugin (classes/plugins/ImportExportPlugin.inc.php``) |
| ``auth`` | ``AuthPlugin (classes/plugins/AuthPlugin.inc.php)`` |
| ``gateways`` | ``GatewayPlugin (classes/plugins/GatewayPlugin.inc.php)`` |

Each base class contains a description of the functions that must be implemented by plugins in that category.

Plugins are managed by the ``PluginRegistry`` class (implemented in ``classes/plugins/PluginRegistry.inc.php``). They can register hooks by using the ``HookRegistry`` class (implemented in ``classes/plugins/HookRegistry.inc.php``).
