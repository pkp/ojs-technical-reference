# Database Support

The basic database functionality is provided by the ADODB library (http://adodb.sourceforge.net); atop the ADODB library is an additional layer of abstraction provided by the Data Access Objects (DAOs). These make use of a few base classes in the ``classes/db`` directory that are extended to provide specific functionality.

- ``DAORegistry.inc.php``: This implements a central registry of Data Access Objects; when a DAO is desired, it is fetched through the DAO registry.
- ``DBConnection.inc.php``: All database connections are established via this class.
- ``DAO.inc.php``: This provides a base class for all DAOs to extend. It provides functions for accessing the database via the ``DBConnection`` class.

In addition, there are several classes that assist with XML parsing and loading into the database:

- ``XMLDAO.inc.php``: Provides operations for retrieving and modifying objects from an XML data source
- ``DBDataXMLParser.inc.php``: Parses an XML schema into SQL statements
