# Additional Plugin Functionality

There are several additional plugin functionalities that may prove useful:

- **Plugin Settings**: Plugins can store and retrieve settings with a mechanism similar to Journal Settings. Use the Plugin class's ``getSetting`` and ``updateSetting`` functions.
- **Templates**: Any plugin can keep templates in its plugin directory and display them by calling:

````
$templateMgr->display($this->getTemplatePath() . 'templateName.tpl');
````

See the native import/export plugin for an example.

- **Schema Management**: By overriding ``getInstallSchemaFile()`` and placing the named schema file in the plugin directory, ``generic`` plugins can make use of OJS's schema-management features. This function is called on OJS install or upgrade.
- **Data Management**: By overriding ``getInstallDataFile()`` and placing the named data file in the plugin directory, ``generic`` plugins can make use of OJS's data installation feature. This function is called on OJS install or upgrade.
- **Helper Code**: Helper code in the plugin's directory can be imported using

````
$this->import('HelperCode'); // imports HelperCode.inc.php
````
