# Model Classes

The Model classes are PHP classes responsible only for representing database entities in memory. For example, the ``articles`` table stores article information in the database; there is a corresponding Model class called ``Article`` (see ``classes/article/Article.inc.php``) and DAO class called ``ArticleDAO`` (see the section called [Data Access Objects](http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/docs/technicalreference/2.1/classReferenceDataAccessObjects.html) [DAOs]).

Methods provided by Model classes are almost exclusively get/set methods to retrieve and store information, such as the ``getTitle()`` and ``setTitle($title)`` methods of the ``Article`` class. Model classes are not responsible for database storage or updates; this is accomplished by the associated DAO class.

All Model classes extend the ``DataObject`` class.
