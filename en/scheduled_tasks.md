# Scheduled Tasks

OJS 2.x is capable of performing regularly-scheduled automated tasks with the help of the operating system, which is responsible for launching the ``tools/runScheduledTasks.php`` script via a mechanism like UNIX's cron. Scheduled tasks must be enabled in the ``config.inc.php`` configuration file and the journal's settings.

Automated tasks are configured in ``registry/scheduledTasks.xml`` and information like the date of a task's last execution is stored in the scheduled_tasks database table.

The ``ScheduledTask`` model class and the associated ``ScheduledTaskDAO`` are responsible for managing these database entries. In addition, the scheduled tasks themselves are implemented in the ``classes/tasks directory``. Currently, only the ``ReviewReminder`` task is implemented, which is responsible for reminding reviewers that they have an outstanding review to complete or indicate acceptance of.

These tasks, which extend the ``ScheduledTask`` model class and are launched by the ``runScheduledTasks`` tool, must implement the execute() method with the task to be performed.
